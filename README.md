# Floyd
The famework for building GraphQL backends, with first-class support for Typescript. You won't need to spend time trying to set up the GraphQL backend, Floyd will do it for you.

## Why
REST APIs are cumbersome to build and even tougher to deal with (for frontend developers). GraphQL eliminates most of the problems developers face while building and using APIs. See more benefits of GraphQL [here](https://graphql.org).

## Concepts
Floyd only has a few concepts you need to understand to get up and running with it. It is made to be as simple as possible to pick up and use.
### Components
A Floyd app is divided into multiple components, with each component having its own **Schema**, **Resolvers** and **Model**.
* Schema: It is a GraphQL schema with its own queries, mutations and subscriptions. Learn more [here](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/)
